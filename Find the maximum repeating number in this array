/*

Given an array of size n, the array contains numbers in range from 0 to k-1 where k is a positive integer
and k <= n. Find the maximum repeating number in this array.

For example, let k be 10 the given array be arr[] = {1, 2, 2,2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 3}, the maximum 
repeating number would be 2. 

Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space allowed is O(1). Modifications to array are allowedï¼Œ
but the original array should be recovered at the end.
